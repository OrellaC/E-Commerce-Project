<h1>Description:</h1>
<p>This project is a demo website for a fake company I created called OrTech Web Builders. The company specializes in website building similar to companies such as Wix and Squarespace. The site is dedicated to selling businesses different website packages that include various APIs to help them create functional user and business friendly websites. </p>

<h3>API Utilization: </h3>
<p>I utilized a total of three APIs to create this site. </p> 
<ol>
<li>The first API utilized is <a href="https://fakestoreapi.com/">Fake Store API </a>. This API was used to render the items under the "shop" page. Users are able to add these items into their cart and then view them under the "cart" page.</li>
<li> The second API utilized is an <a href= "https://eva.pingutil.com/">email verification API </a>. This API can be found on the "coupon" page. Its purpose is to verify the email addresses of users. The API validates whether or not a provided email address is a webmail or not. If the provided email is not a webmail then users are not able to view the coupon code until they provide a valid email.</li>
<li> The third API utilized is a <a href="https://ip-api.com/">geolocation api </a>. This API tracks the location of the current site user. Its purpose is to help business owners locate the region of their target demographic so that they are better able to create advertisements and other promotional material.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Approach Taken:</h3>
<p>This website took me a total of 12 days to create. This was my first time working with APIs in this capacity and I am very proud of the outcome. All of the code was written by me. When I got stuck working on a certain code block or function, I reached out to my instructors (Teo and Manara) for assistance. In addition to writing all of the code for this assignment, I also created 100% of the graphics displayed throughout the site by using the graphic design website <a href="https://www.canva.com/"> Canva</a>.</p>

<h3> Unsolved Issues: </h3>
<ol>
<li> The biggest issue I encountered while creating this project was with the geolocation API. It wasn't until I deployed my site via netlify that I realized the API is HTTP and not HTTPS. Therefore, it is not as secure as HTTPS and only accessible through the local host. In order to make this API feature safe and accessible for all my site users, I will look into buying the paid version of this API which is HTTPS secured or look into using a different API that serves the same purpose </li>
<li> My website is not as accessible as I need it to be. On devices outside of a standard desktop or laptop the website appears to be distorted. </li>
</ol>

<h3>Future Plans for Project:</h3>
<p>My future plans for this project is to solve the aforementioned issues. I would also like to integrate more APIs into this site in order to make it more appealing to potential business owners. For example, I found an API that calculates sales tax based on the user's provided zip code. Due to time restrictions I was not able to implement it. However, I feel that it would be a great addition to future versions of this project</p>
